# Frontend Development

Frontend Development is a pivotal aspect of web development that focuses on crafting the visual and interactive components of a web application. It encompasses two fundamental elements: the graphical design and the user interface (UI) development.

## Graphical Design

In the context of frontend development, graphical design involves conceptualizing and creating the visually appealing layouts, typography, color schemes, and graphical elements that collectively form the aesthetic foundation of the application. Designers employ tools like Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, or Figma to translate ideas into tangible visual assets.

## User Interface (UI) Development

UI development focuses on implementing the graphical design into functional, interactive interfaces that users can seamlessly navigate and engage with. It includes writing codes using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure content, style elements, and add dynamic behavior.
